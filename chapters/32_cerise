Sorry to say, but cerise
According to a most indelible source
Who lives near hue
Is out of it

True... cerise is definitely out
About as out as out's opposite of in

Don't ask me why
Doesn't make any more sense to me than it does to you
To see cerise sitting
Silly
Sad
Moping
Melancholy
Mad
Here in the deepest of dumps

Come, come cerise
What do you think pink'll think
And if fuchsia could see you fussing so
And, oh what gray would say

No, I'm sorry cerise
With your talent for tinging
You should be ashamed!
Every shade of you should
Now you get up
And get out
And start tinging
Or I'll call the police

Did you hear me, cerise?
The police!
Cerise
Did you hear me
