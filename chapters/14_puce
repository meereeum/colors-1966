"Oh... what's the use,"
Says puce
With a more or less colourless sigh
That you can hear from the bottom's low
To the top of most high
From this edge of spectrum
To that...

What's the use
What's the use
What's the use
A rant of the chant
So silly of puce
As silly, I'd say, oh sillier still
Than the silliest silly
Of the silliest goose

Here's the trouble with puce:
Puce
Is a victim
Of loose thinking.
Thinks poetry pays!
No one these days pays the least attention
To things poetic.
Ain't got no time
To waste on rhyme,
But puce doesn't know this.

Could be a screw loose in puce!
Oh well... what's the use.
