Russet
Is the subtle one
Russet
Is the quick one
Russet
Is the obvious one
Russet
Is the slow one
Russet
Knows what goes
Russet,
A fool to its toes
Russet
As wise as an owl
Russet
As dumb as a scowl
Russet
Just kind of is
Russet
Makes sense though
Russet
Nonsensically so
Russet
Like a hero full of zero
Russet
Russet
