Time was
When blue was the saddest
Sadder than that.

Blue was the bluest blue can be blue
No one seemed to care.
Least of all blue.
Though, blue wasn't making it.

But then
On a Thursday
Of a year
Who can remember
Except blue
Something sudden happened.

Blue went as high as sky is high
Flipped fathoms up!
Began to swing easy,
Sensibly
The ways swings should be swung
Like birds sing a song

Now everyone loves the new blue
'Cause it's the truest
You will too!
When you see this blue
True blue
Too true
True blue
Too true
