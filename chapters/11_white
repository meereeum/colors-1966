Take a close look
Yeah...
But much closer than that

Take a real close look
You begin to see why
There’s much more to white —
Much more! —
Than can ever meet the eye

Like, look over there
There
You see that white?
Hah.
Sure looks for sure like the white that’s called pure
But it isn’t
Not at all
That’s an “off white” white

Sorry
Just doesn’t quite measure up
Falls short

Absolutely pure pure white is just a dream
Of a dream
Even now
If you close your eyes tight
And let your brain go
To where it’s whiter than snow
You’ll see!
You’ll know

The whitest
White
That white can be white
As imagined
By you
Imagined by me as the purest of pure pure white
Is just a little bit off.
Just a little bit off...
White
Off-white white
Off-white white
