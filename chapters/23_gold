Oh where would we be
If we didn’t have gold
To back us all up
If we didn’t have gold as a standard

What a terrible question to pose!
What a terrible question to ponder
Now, who would pose questions like those

Think of the gold
Of the goody-good gold
That we love so much more than just much
We love it
So extremely extreme we make sure that the plenty there’s of it

Is always locked up
Guarded by guards who have guns
Guns with real bullets inside ‘em
Ready to shoot
Anyone dead
Who comes for the gold
Who shouldn’t

And all of this, of course,
Is alright —
Righter than that —
As right as right can be right

Still, there’s a problem
I hate to bring it up, but...
Unnatural nature has done it again
Evoluted a moth
Slightly metallic
Who I’ve been told can nibble away at our dear, precious gold
Leaving terrible holes
Holes you can see right through
Leaving us gold reminiscent of Swiss
Oh, what the bankers must think of this!
Swiss gold
