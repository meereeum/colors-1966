Rosalie Rosie Rose O'Grady
Blushing begins
Explaining exactly
Grandly grins
Telling tall tales
To fools out of schools
Who would, if they could --
Knock on wood --
Imitate image

Rosalie Rose as Rosie O'Grady
Rose and her glasses
Her all-male classes
Her punts and her passes
Surpassing us all

Rosie's a coach
Pleases the masses

Lady O'Grady
Some of 'em call her,
But she's really just Rosalie Rosie
Or Rose...
To us

A gem of a feminine gal
Who's a pal to a team
That was gray, oh I'd say,
Several tons anyway

That's our Rosie
Our Rosalie Rosy Rose

A chick of a coach
With a team
That must seem
Like a football dream
Led by a lass
And known foreign-wide simply as Lady O'Grady

Our Rosalie Rosey Rose
Whom everyone knows
