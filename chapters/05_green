As an intellectual vibration smack dab in the middle of spectrum
Green can be a problem
That’s because there’s so many different greens inside of Green and each one has a different IQ
There’s the green that should never have happened:
The “stupid green.”
The green that is “green with envy.”
Then there’s the “so-so green,” the “who-cares-anyway?” green

But somewhere in Green is a green here and there that has something to say:
A truly intelligent green, a green with some integrity

That’s the kind of green for you and me
There’s a green to be seen with: vivid, vibrant, living alive!
We should spend the better part of our time, yours and mine, with a green like this
Maybe some of it would rub off
