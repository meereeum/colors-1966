Innocent as an innocent can be innocent
Is nutria

Nobody knows who you are, nutria
You are definitely, definitively unknown
About as unknown as the color can get
Yet,
You persist in this nonsense --
As the innocent so often do --
Of becoming someone big

With a name
You, a big name
You, up there in lights
A show of your own
Nutria presents!
Nutria being nutria!

Hahaha
What a child of a color you can be
Do you think
Do you really really think
That light would ever be allowed to allow you a stage
Only for you?

You've got to stop dreaming dreams
That should never be dreamt
Wake up, nutria!

Get yourself a red manager
An orange agent
A yellow writer
A green salesman
A blue tailor
An indigo barber
A violet taxman

Then!
Maybe then!
If they play your cards right
Innocent as an innocent can be innocent
Nutria
You might become known

But then again, nutria...
