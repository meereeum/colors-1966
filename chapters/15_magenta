Have you heard about magenta?
Magnificent news...

Has her own gossip column
And almost the freedom,
To say almost anything,
She almost wants.
About almost any color shade,
Tint, or hue,
That you and I know

Think of the juicy little tidbits of insight
That we can get from her...
Exclusive peeks
At what lavender said to magenta
About the way fuchsia’s been fooling around with cerise
While russet is off to who-knows-where
With forest green,
And all his crony colors
...That sort of thing

You know how witty
And well-connected
Magenta is

In no time at all, her column will be as much a part
Of the Grievening blues
Or the laughternoon capers
As the stock quotations

Did you see her column on heliotrope?
The whole column!
Was it ever an eye opener.
Seems that heliotrope is taking instructions
From indigo,
In color balance.
Think of that...

Why, magenta might become as big as chartreuse!
Or maybe even turquoise
Now that she has
A column of her own...
I’m so glad
For magenta
