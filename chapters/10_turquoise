Gee, you shouldn't have
Course you did, couldn't help yourself
Had to
Turquoise, don't you know how simple you are?
Don't you know what effect you're having on everything?
See the flash of you
Turquoise
There, by her gliding through the light
And by such swifts and shifts of slight
Also there you go
All streaks of turquoise blur
Definitely so
And here, here a turquoise all tender
Trembling like water
What do you think of a turquoise like that?
Then there's this turquoise
And that turquoise
Oh, turquoise, you shouldn't have
Course you did
Couldn't help yourself
Until
Isn't that right?
Oh there's something that you can teach
Turquoise
