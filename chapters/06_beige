Impossible to understand beige.
Unless you stare at him hard,
Stare him right in his whys

Unless you see beige
In the serious beige-ness of being its beige self.
More than anything
Beige is careful —
Insanely so really —
Almost as careful as that shade of yellow that’s afraid

But beige is much sneakier than yellow,
Wants the entire everything to be as safe as yesterday is,
Now that right now is here

You know how flamboyant red can be?
Humph, wouldn’t last a minute with beige,
Probably wouldn’t get past his secretary,
Miss always-light tan

Beige even thinks orange is a little too far out,
The way its streak sunrise and sets.
And just the mention of green, and beige sees purple
Which also drives him into a rage

Of course, it's only a beige rage
Not much strength to it
To be honest as lily white,
The truth is that beige is anti-color
Unless the color is right
Unless the color is, beige.

About as average as you can get away with seeing
Is the gray way beige likes to have things being
