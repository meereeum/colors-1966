Impossible to understand beige,
Unless you stare at him hard,
Stare him right in his Whys.

Unless you see beige
In the serious beige-ness of being its beige self.
More than anything,
Beige is careful,
Insanely so really,
Almost as careful as that shade of yellow that’s afraid.

But beige is much sneakier than yellow,
wants the entire everything to be as safe as yesterday is,
now that right now is here.

You know how flamboyant red can be?
Humph, wouldn’t last a minute with beige, probably wouldn’t get past his secretary, miss always-light tan.

Beige even thinks orange is a little too far out,
The way its streak sunrise and sets.
And the just the mention of green and beige sees purple,
Which also drives him into a rage

Of course its only a beige rage.
Not much strength to it.
To be honest as lily white,
The truth is that beige is anti-color,
Unless the color is right,
Unless the color is, beige.

About as average as you can get away with seeing
Is the gray way beige likes to have things being.
