Amber believes in being neutral
Or more correctly, has been placed in a position
To make it appear
That that is its truth.

Pure amber neutrality
Here, in the dizzying come-and-go
Amber -- being in the middle --
observes a most careful disinterestedness

Plays referee in the roundabout between red and green
Amber from its vantage winks
Among the many millions stops and goes
Because amber knows from the bottom of it amber
That even creatures made in God's image
Even something as smart and as special and as serious as that
Has to be told when to stop
Has to be told when to go

Or the monuments to gregarious,
That we call cities,
Would become huge falling-apart hopelessly-snarled
Bumper-to-bumper horn-blasting monuments to traffic jam

If amber would be on all the time
Staring, neutral amber
Death to a million angry, biased horns
