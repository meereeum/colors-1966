Lavender is an old, old, old, old lady
Lavender is, arenâ€™t you?
I thought you were

Lady lavender in the indigo house
By the purple wood
Cobwebbed by spiders in magic magenta

Lavender, keeper of dark corners
In black, blue blood

Lady of the soft edges, tell us all or tell me
Where day goes with night
And what they do there
And what it means

The questions fall on your lavender lap
And your answer is
A lavender laugh
In a lavender cry
Near a lavender watch
By a lavender why
