Funny thing about mud —
It’s a color
That isn’t thought of as so.

But as sure as there’s green leaf green
Or blood red blood
You can also be sure there’s muddy mud mud.
As a color, I mean.

And which, if it weren’t all around,
Would leave little hope
For a bar we call soap

Mud, or muddy (whichever you prefer)
Is the bane of existence to every human her.
But to the sellers of soap,
Mud, or muddy, is the great white hope

Hooray for dirt,
And even dust.
Both are considered a muddy mud must

So next time you say “oh no” to yourself
When muddy mud mud makes dirty what’s clean
Think what this doggerel’s logic has been
As you take from its shelf the antidote soap

If there wasn’t a color called mud,
Or muddy,
Or muddy mud mud...
There would be very little hope
For soap
