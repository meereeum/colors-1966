Flesh
As a color
Is in an awful mess

Yes

Ask anyone with flesh
They'll tell ya

Flesh
As a color
Is about as close to a problem
As a color can get

Some people think
The only color flesh color should be is the color their flesh color is
Which
Pure and simple
Is color-centric thinking

Popular in some corners

But you and I know, though, that
The proper color for flesh to be is the proper color it is
Varying from complexion to complexion

But if
Black flesh and
White flesh and
Brown flesh and
Red flesh and
Yellow flesh and
Tan flesh

If all the fleshes that are flesh
Want to establish a sensible similarity among differences
We'd better forget the flesh and the colors it can be
And think on the spirit and its singular light

Otherwise flesh as a color
Could be black and blue
Or even
A bloody hue
