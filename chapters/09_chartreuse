Chartreuse wanted to quit
Why not?

Figured it would go off somewhere
Be by itself
Maybe let green,
Or yellow,
Take over
Get away from it all.

That's what chartreuse wanted
Food needs chameleons
What difference
Would it make
In the immense design of things,
If certain feathers were some other color

Parrots wouldn't care
Nor would parakeets
But what about the leaves of rhubarb
Ohhh

Chartreuse began to tremble
Just thinking of the trouble rhubarb make
You know rhubarb
And the rhubarb that rhubarb could cause

So chartreuse decided not to give notice,
Not for a while anyway,
Besides isn't that a nervous katydid over there
That needs a new coloring
Of course

Chartreuse
Gonna stay
Because it feels
Used
