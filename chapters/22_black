Black
As the ace of spades is
Black
As a hole in Calcutta is
Black
As a Jack in the game is
Black
As my true love's hair is
Black
As a dreamless sleep is
Black
As a midnight is
Black
As closing your eyes tight is
Black
As a little black sheep is
Black
One in every family
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
