In the beginning--
Oh, long before that--

When light was deciding
Who should be in
And who should be out
Of the spectrum
Yellow was in trouble

Even then it seems that Green
(you know how Green can be)
Didn't want Yellow in
Some silly primal envy I suppose
But for whatever cause
The effect was bad on Yellow
And caused Yellow to weep yellow tears
For several eternals
Before there were years

Until Blue heard what was up
Between Green and Yellow
And took Green aside for a serious talk
In which Blue pointed out
That if Yellow and Blue were to get together
Not that they would but if they did
(a gentle threat)
They could make their own green
"Ohhh" said Green with some understanding
Naturally by a sudden change of hue
Green saw the light and Yellow got in
It worked out fine
Yellow got lemons
And green got limes
