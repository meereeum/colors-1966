About hazel
There’s something
Who can say what, or why it should be

But there’s something
So silly
No, much worse than that

Willy nilly silly is a better way to say
The way hazel’s been behaving
On this silliest of days

I mean, really.
Hazel!
Who would have thought —
And at her age, too —
Just shows you!

Hazel should have stuck to just coloring eyes
The world isn’t ready for this hazel surprise
Are you?
I’m not

I mean...
Enough’s enough
Who needs
Hazel-colored evil
Hazel-colored good
Hazel-colored shouldn’t
Hazel-colored should
Hazel-colored laughter
Hazel-colored cry
Hazel-colored birthday
Hazel-colored die
Hazel-colored happy
Hazel-colored sad
Hazel-colored mother
Hazel-colored dad

No...
The world isn’t ready
Not to my eyes,
Which are brown,
For the willy nilly silly that this hazel surprise
Are you?
I’m not.
I mean!
