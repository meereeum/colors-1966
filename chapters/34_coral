Coral, as a color, is an absolute flip
Coral is as hip as the hippiest of hips
Don’t ask me why, just is

Coral knows what goes
Knows that it knows!
Knows it before it happens
Even then, then when something is just maybe thinking
Of maybe just beginning to begin
Even then
Coral knows
That’s how hip coral is

So let me tell you what the new bit’ll be
According to coral
As coral told me

In just a few years
Maybe more, maybe less
We’ll praise only stupid
You heard me
Yes, I know that sounds dumb
But according to coral
Who’s the hippest of hips
Stupidity pays
Especially these days
So, stupid will praise
Maybe not now, but in a few years
If coral’s correct
In what it says about this
Ignorance may well become a most popular bliss

...Just according to coral
