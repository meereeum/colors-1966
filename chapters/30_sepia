They're about to begin
The group called Oop
C'mon in...

Muck
That's sepia
Smooth as a smoothie is smooth
On the edge of it all
Wiser than otherwise is
Like the else of something else

Oh
They're about to begin the beginning of begin..
That's yellow ocher playing around
Swaying sound
With the loose tendrils of his ticky tock time

And that!
Oh ho,
That's burnt umber!

Just got out
You remember umber
Who could forget umber
The way he was burnt

Oh, there's good old rosianna
Playing changes
Look at him good
Goofiness, inc
But as thoughtful as think

Hey!
Sepia is about to play
Smooth as a smoothie is smooth
On the edge of it all 
Wiser than otherwise is
Like the else of something else
A most colorful group
Called Oop
