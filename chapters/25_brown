Brown
Among purists, and you know how many purists there are,
Brown was having some difficulty

Some of the purists wanted brown to be more...
Others wanted brown to be more...
Still others wanted brown to be...
To be basically brown

Yeah...
A lesser color might have fallen apart
But brown met the problem beautifully
By becoming just about as basic
Just about as subtle
As you can just about get

That’s why you hear so many people saying
“My, that’s a subtle brown”

That’s the way it’s been ever since
Even with a light tan
Or sweet dark chocolate
Or deep brown eyes

Next time you see brown,
Any shade,
Remember:
Subtle
Basic
Brown
