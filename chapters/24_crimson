There's something in crimson
Something that should be stopped

Stop now
Not later
But now

Here's why:

Crimson is sick
Sick in its red
No telling what crimson might do
If the notion should start in its head

Might blow us all up
Who knows

Know what the trouble in crimson is?
Doesn't know when to stop

Always wants more
And more
And more
And more

I'll bet you that every war that's even been fought
Was fought most of all because crimson was taught
To want more
And more
And more
And more

Like I said
Crimson?
You're sick!
Sick in the red

No telling what crimson might do
If the notion should start in its head

Watch out!
Watch out!
For crimson!
