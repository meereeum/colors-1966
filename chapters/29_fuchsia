Fuchsia is a fussbudget of the worstest kind
Wants everything everywhere
To be her color

Which, when you stop to blink about it,
Is as silly as everything everywhere ivory
Or everything everywhere ultramarine
Or everything everywhere burnt umber

But... fuchsia wants the world her way
Monochromatically fuchsia

Well naturally all the other colors want fuchsia put away
Anywhere, out of sight!

Monomania, especially in a color, is the worst
Requiring long careful treatment

Oh, if only fuchsia would go see that sensible someone
Who's straightened out heliotrope
You remember the trouble heliotrope had...
Thinking the sun should shine for her and her only
Strikes me is the same sickness fuchsia now faces!

If you have any influence
As I don't
If you do
Maybe you could get this silly silly hue
To see the light
Right?

We don't want to lose ya,
Fuchsia,
Not by a blinkety blank sight!
So please
Please please
Fuchsia
Won't you please see the light?
