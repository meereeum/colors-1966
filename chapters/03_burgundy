Burgundy...
Is fat
Sorry to be so blunt
But that's burgundy

Fat burstingly burgundy, so...
But also soft
So fatly soft
So softly fat
That you begin to wonder
Really, how does burgundy,
As soft and as fat as it is,
Manage to keep up
Where does it hide its huffing and puffing
And the deep, deep drowsiness
After the tall dinner

Come, come, big burgundy
What do you weigh
How much have you gained since the burginning
Beautiful burgeoning burgundy
Big big burgundy
Fat fat fat as a burgundy cat
