Olive, poor thing
Sits and thinks
That it's drab
Sure does

Sits and sits and sits and sits
And thinks
About its olive drab drab
Doesn't know that its about to be named
Color of the year
By those with the nose for the new
By the passionate few

Yeah
Olive is definitely in
Everything that can possibly mean anything
Anywhere
At least for a year
Has got to be olive
Did you hear that olive? Did ya?
Know what it means

Oh, olive
There'll be olive cars
And olive trucks
And olive chickens
And olive ducks
And olive socks
And olive garters
And olive breaks
And olive starters

Olive sorry
Olive please
Olive whatnots
And olive trees
Olive trees?
What a quaint notion
Olive trees
