If there’s an absolute white,
And there is,
And if there’s an absolute black,
And there is,
Then follows that there must be an absolute grey.

Absolute grey is the perfect grey
There’s the same distance from
Absolute white as it is from absolute black
Not whitegrey or blackgrey
But absolutely perfect grey

White, black, grey.
White, black, grey.
White, black, grey.
