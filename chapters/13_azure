As sure as there’s azure, it’s true
Azure is bored just being blue

A fact that has caused our dear friend
To act sort of silly
Like it’s at its wit’s ends

Azure’s as way out as wink
Maybe more out than that
Maybe winkier than wink
You’d never have guessed, but azure can think
Of the craziest things to do
Besides tinting the atmosphere’s top, I mean
The part we all call “sky blue”

Azure would rather, so I’ve been told,
Let the sky be a white upside-down bowl
That azure could azure with clouds inside
Or possibly freckle with birds

Look, if azure could read or write in a book
It would want every thought it could azurely think
To be written in azure, with azure ink
Why?

Just to be different
That’s the name of the game
You see, azure can’t stand being anything same
