Purple
All dignity
All pomp
All put on
Has an aura to be felt,
As well as seen.

Purple has class.
Some say the highest.
They stand in all approval of purple.
Royally, loyally in awe.

This alone makes pompous purple king
King purple feels there's a right that is his
That goes way way back to beginning
To the place where pomp began.
That is, purple pomp

Some say -- those in the know --
That purple got pomp
From the first of the purple queens
From mother pomp
Who thought it all up

The purple dignity
the purple pomp
The purple put-on

Thought it all up,
So anyone purple
From then until now
Would never have to ever, ever work
And that's why purple is king
