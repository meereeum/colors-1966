Take all the colors under the sun
Only one color I think much fun
And that’s orange
Orange I said
The silly old color who lives next to red
The one that is orangely out of its head
That giggles and titters and rolls in the aisle
No matter what happens, guffaws all the while
Old orange
As flip as a Heiseman coin
Or a stone skipping waterly skips
As free as a spree
With a bird’s supposed to be
If a spree with a bird could be free
Why not?
An orangey bird with orangey wings
With orangey songs that it orangey sings
That orangely comes as it orangely goes
Laughing in orange from its head to its toes
When everything’s orangey, goofy like this
Trouble’s a joke, just an orangey joke
So’s sorrow and sadness and sigh
Just jokes to poke orangey pokes at
Only one trouble troubles Orange
If you please
That’s in the morning
It’s the trouble called “squeeze”
Changing orangey orange
Into vitamin C’s
